This solution matrix represents the heat exchange possibilities within a Heat Exchanger Network (HEN), based on defined temperature intervals. The rows of the matrix correspond to temperature intervals (or "temperature levels") calculated using a specified minimum temperature difference (Î”Tmin), while the columns represent the individual process and utility streams involved in the network.
